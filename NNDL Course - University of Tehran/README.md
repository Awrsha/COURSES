## Introduction

This section covers the fundamentals of neural networks, including natural and artificial neural networks, architectures, activation functions, and learning mechanisms.

## Fully Connected Neural Networks

This section delves into fully connected neural networks, exploring linear perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), autoencoders, and restricted Boltzmann machines.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Here, the focus shifts to convolutional neural networks, discussing architectures, developments, and techniques, along with popular models like AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, and others.

## Region based CNNs

This section explores CNNs tailored for specific tasks such as object detection and segmentation, covering models like RCNN, Mask RCNN, and UNet.

## Recurrent Neural Networks

The recurrent neural networks section covers RNNs, LSTM, GRU, and their extensions for sequential data processing.

## Transformers

The transformers section discusses attention mechanisms and introduces the vanilla transformer model, with a focus on vision-based applications.

## Deep Generative Models

Finally, this section explores various deep generative models, including variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, flow-based models, and diffusion models.

## Mini Projects and Exams

Students are evaluated through a series of mini-projects and exams, with the course content divided accordingly.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Mini Projects: 60%
- Exams: 40% (Midterm: 20%, Final: 20%)

## Additional Information

- Optional mini-projects are available for extra credit.
